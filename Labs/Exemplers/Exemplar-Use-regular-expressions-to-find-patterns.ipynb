    "- Regular expressions in Python allow you to create patterns that you can then use to find important strings. \n",
    "- Regular expression patterns can be built to match specific characters and character combinations. \n",
    "- Examples of regular expression symbols practiced in this lab:\n",
    "  - `\\w` represents any alphanumeric character.\n",
    "  - `+` represents one or more occurrences of the previous character in the regular expression.\n",
    "  - `\\d` represents any digit.\n",
    "  - `\\.` represents a period. \n",
    "  - `{x,y}` represents anywhere between x and y number of occurrences of the previous character in the regular expression. The x and y can be replaced with any two positive integers to indicate an exact range for the number of occurrences.\n",
    "- The `re` module in Python contains functions that are useful when working with regular expressions. \n",
    "  - One example is the `re.findall()` function, which takes in a regular expression pattern as well as a string, checks for all instances in the string that match with the pattern and outputs a list of the matches. "
