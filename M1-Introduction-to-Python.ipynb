    "## Get to know Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, you will explore how programming works, how a computer processes the Python programming language, and how Python is used in cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How programming works \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Computer programs exist everywhere. Computers, cell phones, and many other electronic devices are all given instructions by computer programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple programming languages used to create computer programs. Python is one of these. Programming languages are converted to binary numbers, which are a series of 0s and 1s that represent the operations that the computer's central processing unit (CPU) should perform. Each instruction corresponds to a specific operation, such as adding two numbers or loading a value from memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be very time-consuming for humans to communicate this way. Programming languages like Python make it easier to write code because you can use less syntax when instructing computers to perform complex processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Python to program\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general purpose programming language that can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, it can be used to build websites, perform data analysis, and automate tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python code must be converted through an interpreter before the computer can process it. An interpreter is a computer program that translates Python code into runnable instructions line by line. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python versions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple versions of Python. In this course, you are using Python 3. While using Python, it's important to keep track of the version you're using. There are differences in the syntax of each version. Syntax refers to the rules that determine what is correctly structured in a computing language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python in cybersecurity\n",
    "\n",
    "In cybersecurity, Python is used especially for automation. Automation is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort to perform common and repetitive tasks. These are some specific areas of cybersecurity in which Python might be used to automate specific tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log analysis\n",
    "- Malware analysis\n",
    "- Access control list management\n",
    "- Intrusion detection\n",
    "- Compliance checks\n",
    "- Network scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language, or in other words, a language used to create instructions for a computer to complete tasks. Programming languages are converted to binary numbers that a machine can understand. It's important to be aware that there are multiple versions of Python, and they have differences in syntax. Python is especially useful in cybersecurity for automating repetitive tasks."

    "## Python environments\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Python through a variety of environments. These environments include notebooks, integrated development environments (IDEs), and the command line. This reading will introduce you to these environments. It will focus primarily on notebooks because this is how you'll interact with Python in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to write Python code is through a notebook. In this course, you'll interact with Python through notebooks. A notebook is an online interface for writing, storing, and running code. They also allow you to document information about the code. Notebook content either appears in a code cell or markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells are meant for writing and running code. A notebook provides a mechanism for running these code cells. Often, this is a play button located within the cell. When you run the code, its output appears after the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells are meant for describing the code. They allow you to format text in the markdown language. Markdown language is used for formatting plain text in text editors and code editors. For example, you might indicate that text should be in a certain header style. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common notebook environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common notebook environments are Jupyter Notebook and Google Colaboratory (or Google Colab). They allow you to run several programming languages, including Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrated development environments (IDEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option for writing Python code is through an integrated development environment (IDE), or a software application for writing code that provides editing assistance and error correction tools. Integrated development environments include a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides programmers with a variety of options to customize and build their programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Command line\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is another environment that allows you to run Python programs. Previously, you learned that a command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer. By entering commands into the command line, you can access all files and directories saved on your hard drive, including files containing Python code you want to run. You can also use the command line to open a file editor and create a new Python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Security analysts can access Python through a variety of environments, including notebooks, integrated development environments, and the command line. In this course, you'll use notebooks, which are online interfaces for interacting with code. Notebooks contain code cells for writing and running code as well as markdown cells for plain text descriptions."

    "### Best practices for naming variables \n",
    "\n",
    "You can name a variable almost anything you want, but there are a few guidelines you should follow to ensure correct syntax and prevent errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use only letters, numbers, and underscores in variable names. Valid examples: date_3, username, interval2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start a variable name with a letter or underscore. Do not start it with a number. Valid examples: time,  _login\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember that variable names in Python are case-sensitive. These are all different variables: time, Time, TIME, timE.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use Python’s built-in keywords or functions for variable names. For example, variables shouldn't be named True, False, or if.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you should follow these stylistic guidelines to make your code easier for you and other security analysts to read and understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Separate two or more words with underscores. Valid examples: login_attempts, invalid_user, status_update\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid variables with similar names. These variables could be easily confused with one another: start_time, starting_time, time_starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid unnecessarily long names for variables. For instance, don't give variables names like variable_that_equals_3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Names should describe the data and not be random words. Valid examples: num_login_attempts, device_id, invalid_usernames\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Using underscores to separate multiple words in variables is recommended, but another convention that you might encounter is capitalizing the first letter of each word except the first word. Example: loginAttempt\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important for security analysts to have a fundamental understanding of variables. Variables are containers of data. They are assigned values and can also be reassigned other values or variables. It's helpful to remember the best practices for naming variables in order to create more functional, readable code. "
