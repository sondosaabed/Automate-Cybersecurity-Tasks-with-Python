# Automate-Cybersecurity-Tasks-with-Python

In this course, I develop a greater understanding of computer programming in Python and how Python can be effectively used to automate security-related tasks. I started with key foundational concepts in Python, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements. I then developed functions in Python and work with string and list data in a variety of ways. Finally, I explore algorithms that involve importing and parsing files.
