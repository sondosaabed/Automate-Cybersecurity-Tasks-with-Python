# Automate-Cybersecurity-Tasks-with-Python

In this course, I develop a greater understanding of computer programming in Python and how Python can be effectively used to automate security-related tasks. I started with key foundational concepts in Python, including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements. I then developed functions in Python and work with string and list data in a variety of ways. Finally, I explore algorithms that involve importing and parsing files.

## Syllabus

### Module 1 :Introduction to Python
I got an introduction to the Python programming language and how Python is used in cybersecurity. I also explored foundational Python concepts including data types, variables, conditional statements, and iterative statements.

### Module 2: Write effective Python code
I expand my ability to work with Python. I learn about pre-built and user-defined Python functions. I also explore how modules help provide access to reusable code. Finally, I make my code more readable.

### Module 3: Work with strings and lists
I learned more options for working with strings and lists in Python, and discovered methods that can be applied to these data types. I applied this knowledge to write a short algorithm. Finally, I used regular expressions to search for patterns in strings.

### Module 4: Python in practice
I put Python into practice and focus on automating cybersecurity-related tasks, which requires working with files. I am introduced to opening and reading files. Then, I learned to parse files and structure their contents. Finally, I then focus on strategies for debugging code.
