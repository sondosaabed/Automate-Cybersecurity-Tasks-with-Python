    "The ability to work with strings is important in the cybersecurity profession. Previously, you were introduced to several ways to work with strings, including functions and methods.

It also highlights examples of string data you might encounter in a security setting.\n",

    "### String data in a security setting\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analyst, string data is one of the most common data types you will encounter in Python. String data is data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters. It's used to store any type of information you don't need to manipulate mathematically (such as through division or subtraction). In a cybersecurity context, this includes IP addresses, usernames, URLs, and employee IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to work with these strings in a variety of ways. For example, you might extract certain parts of an IP address, or you might verify whether usernames meet required criteria.\n",

    "### Working with indices in strings\n",
    "#### Indices \n",
    "\n",
    "An index is a number assigned to every element in a sequence that indicates its position. With strings, this means each character in the string has its own index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indices start at 0. For example, you might be working with this string containing a device ID: \"h32rb17\". The following table indicates the index for each character in this string:\n",

There are many functions in the re module, but you will explore how regular expressions work through re.findall(). The re.findall() function returns a list of matches to a regular expression. It requires two parameters. The first is the string containing the regular expression pattern, and the second is the string you want to search through.\n",

    "The patterns that comprise a regular expression consist of alphanumeric characters and special symbols. If a regular expression pattern consists only of alphanumeric characters, Python will review the specified string for matches to this pattern and return them. In the following example, the first parameter is a regular expression pattern consisting only of the alphanumeric characters \"ts\". The second parameter, \"tsnow, tshah, bmoreno\",  is the string it will search through. You can run the following code to explore what it returns:\n"
