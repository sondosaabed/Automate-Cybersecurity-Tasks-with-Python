    "## Python functions in cybersecurity\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, you explored how to define and call your own functions. In this reading, you’ll revisit what you learned about functions and examine how functions can improve efficiency in a cybersecurity setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions in cybersecurity\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a section of code that can be reused in a program. Functions are important in Python because they allow you to automate repetitive parts of your code. In cybersecurity, you will likely adopt some processes that you will often repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with security logs, you will often encounter tasks that need to be repeated. For example, if you were responsible for finding malicious login activity based on failed login attempts, you might have to repeat the process for multiple logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work around that, you could define a function that takes a log as its input and returns all potentially malicious logins. It would be easy to apply this function to different logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you'll work with built-in functions and user-defined functions. Built-in functions are functions that exist within Python and can be called directly. The print() function is an example of a built-in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined functions are functions that programmers design for their specific needs. To define a function, you need to include a function header and the body of your function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function header\n",
    "\n",
    "The function header is what tells Python that you are starting to define a function. For example, if you want to define a function that displays an \"investigate activity\" message, you can include this function header:\n",
    "\n",
    "def display_investigation_message():\n",
    "\n",
    "The def keyword is placed before a function name to define a function. In this case, the name of that function is display_investigation_message. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parentheses that follow the name of the function and the colon (:) at the end of the function header are also essential parts of the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro tip: When naming a function, give it a name that indicates what it does. This will make it easier to remember when calling it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function body\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the function is an indented block of code after the function header that defines what the function does. The indentation is very important when writing a function because it separates the definition of a function from the rest of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a body to your definition of the display_investigation_message() function, add an indented line with the print() function. Your function definition becomes the following:"

This happens when it is not combined with logic that stops the function call when certain conditions are met. For example, in the following function definition, after you first call func1(), it will continue to call itself and create an infinite loop: "

    "A parameter is an object that is included in a function definition for use in that function. When you define a function, you create variables in the function header.

In the following example, the information returned from the call to remaining_login_attempts is stored in a variable called remaining_attempts. Then, this variable is used in a conditional that prints a \"Your account is locked\" message when remaining_attempts is less than or equal to 0. You can run this code to explore its output:"

A better way to pass different values into a function is to use a parameter instead of a global variable.\n",
